Practice program using active record and ruby. Users can: enter names of employees, assign them to divisions (one division per employee), assign them to projects (employees can have multiple projects, projects can have multiple employees--has_and_belongs_to_many association), and take related actions.  Additionally, for purposes of having a has_many:through association type, users can record employee contributions to a separate type of projects: "Big Deals". Users can additionally search contributions by employee name and by Big Deal name.
